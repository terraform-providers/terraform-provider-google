# google\_container\_cluster

Manages a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/clusters)
and [the API reference](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.clusters).

~> **Note:** All arguments and attributes, including basic auth username and
passwords as well as certificate outputs will be stored in the raw state as
plaintext. [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage - with a separately managed node pool (recommended)

```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name     = "my-gke-cluster"
  location = "us-central1"

  # We can't create a cluster with no node pool defined, but we want to only use
  # separately managed node pools. So we create the smallest possible default
  # node pool and immediately delete it.
  remove_default_node_pool = true
  initial_node_count       = 1

  master_auth {
    username = ""
    password = ""

    client_certificate_config {
      issue_client_certificate = false
    }
  }
}

resource "google_container_node_pool" "primary_preemptible_nodes" {
  name       = "my-node-pool"
  location   = "us-central1"
  cluster    = google_container_cluster.primary.name
  node_count = 1

  node_config {
    preemptible  = true
    machine_type = "n1-standard-1"

    metadata = {
      disable-legacy-endpoints = "true"
    }

    oauth_scopes = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring",
    ]
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - with the default node pool

```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name               = "marcellus-wallace"
  location           = "us-central1-a"
  initial_node_count = 3

  master_auth {
    username = ""
    password = ""

    client_certificate_config {
      issue_client_certificate = false
    }
  }

  node_config {
    oauth_scopes = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring",
    ]

    metadata = {
      disable-legacy-endpoints = "true"
    }

    labels = {
      foo = "bar"
    }

    tags = ["foo", "bar"]
  }

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    update = "40m"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name of the cluster, unique within the project and
location.

- - -

* `location` - (Optional) The location (region or zone) in which the cluster
master will be created, as well as the default node location. If you specify a
zone (such as `us-central1-a`), the cluster will be a zonal cluster with a
single cluster master. If you specify a region (such as `us-west1`), the
cluster will be a regional cluster with multiple masters spread across zones in
the region, and with default node locations in those zones as well

* `node_locations` - (Optional) The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.

-> A "multi-zonal" cluster is a zonal cluster with at least one additional zone
defined; in a multi-zonal cluster, the cluster master is only present in a
single zone while nodes are present in each of the primary zone and the node
locations. In contrast, in a regional cluster, cluster master nodes are present
in multiple zones in the region. For that reason, regional clusters should be
preferred.

* `addons_config` - (Optional) The configuration for addons supported by GKE.
    Structure is documented below.

* `cluster_ipv4_cidr` - (Optional) The IP address range of the Kubernetes pods
in this cluster in CIDR notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`). Leave blank to have one
automatically chosen or specify a `/14` block in `10.0.0.0/8`. This field will
only work for routes-based clusters, where `ip_allocation_policy` is not defined.

* `cluster_autoscaling` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))
Per-cluster configuration of Node Auto-Provisioning with Cluster Autoscaler to
automatically adjust the size of the cluster and create/delete node pools based
on the current needs of the cluster's workload. See the
[guide to using Node Auto-Provisioning](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning)
for more details. Structure is documented below.

* `database_encryption` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)).
    Structure is documented below.

* `description` - (Optional) Description of the cluster.

* `default_max_pods_per_node` - (Optional) The default maximum number of pods
per node in this cluster. This doesn't work on "routes-based" clusters, clusters
that don't have IP Aliasing enabled. See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr)
for more information.

* `enable_binary_authorization` - (Optional) Enable Binary Authorization for this cluster.
    If enabled, all container images will be validated by Google Binary Authorization.

* `enable_kubernetes_alpha` - (Optional) Whether to enable Kubernetes Alpha features for
    this cluster. Note that when this option is enabled, the cluster cannot be upgraded
    and will be automatically deleted after 30 days.

* `enable_tpu` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) Whether to enable Cloud TPU resources in this cluster.
    See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/kubernetes-engine-setup).

* `enable_legacy_abac` - (Optional) Whether the ABAC authorizer is enabled for this cluster.
    When enabled, identities in the system, including service accounts, nodes, and controllers,
    will have statically granted permissions beyond those provided by the RBAC configuration or IAM.
    Defaults to `false`

* `enable_shielded_nodes` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) Enable Shielded Nodes features on all nodes in this cluster.  Defaults to `false`.

* `initial_node_count` - (Optional) The number of nodes to create in this
cluster's default node pool. In regional or multi-zonal clusters, this is the
number of nodes per zone. Must be set if `node_pool` is not set. If you're using
`google_container_node_pool` objects with no default node pool, you'll need to
set this to a value of at least `1`, alongside setting
`remove_default_node_pool` to `true`.

* `ip_allocation_policy` - (Optional) Configuration of cluster IP allocation for
VPC-native clusters. Adding this block enables [IP aliasing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-aliases),
making the cluster VPC-native instead of routes-based. Structure is documented
below.

* `logging_service` - (Optional) The logging service that the cluster should
    write logs to. Available options include `logging.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver),
    `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Logging), and `none`. Defaults to `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`

* `maintenance_policy` - (Optional) The maintenance policy to use for the cluster. Structure is
    documented below.

* `master_auth` - (Optional) The authentication information for accessing the
Kubernetes master. Some values in this block are only returned by the API if
your service account has permission to get credentials for your GKE cluster. If
you see an unexpected diff removing a username/password or unsetting your client
cert, ensure you have the `container.clusters.getCredentials` permission.
Structure is documented below.

* `master_authorized_networks_config` - (Optional) The desired configuration options
    for master authorized networks. Omit the nested `cidr_blocks` attribute to disallow
    external access (except the cluster node IPs, which GKE automatically whitelists).

* `min_master_version` - (Optional) The minimum version of the master. GKE
    will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
    current master version--use the read-only `master_version` field to obtain that.
    If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
    official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
    the `google_container_engine_versions` data source useful - it indicates which versions
    are available, and can be use to approximate fuzzy versions in a
    Terraform-compatible way. If you intend to specify versions manually,
    [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades#specifying_cluster_version)
    describe the various acceptable formats for this field.

-> If you are using the `google_container_engine_versions` datasource with a regional cluster, ensure that you have provided a `location`
to the datasource. A region can have a different set of supported versions than its corresponding zones, and not all zones in a
region are guaranteed to support the same version.

* `monitoring_service` - (Optional) The monitoring service that the cluster
    should write metrics to.
    Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
    VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting
    Available options include
    `monitoring.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver), `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring), and `none`.
    Defaults to `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`

* `network` - (Optional) The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
    network to which the cluster is connected. For Shared VPC, set this to the self link of the
    shared network.

* `network_policy` - (Optional) Configuration options for the
    [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/networkpolicies/)
    feature. Structure is documented below.

* `node_config` -  (Optional) Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
    Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
    `google_container_node_pool` or a `node_pool` block; this configuration
    manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used with
    Terraform. Structure is documented below.

* `node_pool` - (Optional) List of node pools associated with this cluster.
    See [google_container_node_pool](container_node_pool.html) for schema.
    **Warning:** node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
    cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
    to say "these are the _only_ node pools associated with this cluster", use the
    [google_container_node_pool](container_node_pool.html) resource instead of this property.

* `node_version` - (Optional) The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
    or set to the same value as `min_master_version` on create. Defaults to the default
    version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
    nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
    recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
    when fuzzy versions are used. See the `google_container_engine_versions` data source's
    `version_prefix` field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.
    To update nodes in other node pools, use the `version` attribute on the node pool.

* `pod_security_policy_config` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) Configuration for the
    [PodSecurityPolicy](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-security-policies) feature.
    Structure is documented below.

* `authenticator_groups_config` - (Optional) Configuration for the
    [Google Groups for GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#groups-setup-gsuite) feature.
    Structure is documented below.

    [Release channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels)
    feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters. Structure is documented below.

* `remove_default_node_pool` - (Optional) If `true`, deletes the default node
    pool upon cluster creation. If you're using `google_container_node_pool`
    resources with no default node pool, this should be set to `true`, alongside
    setting `initial_node_count` to at least `1`.

* `resource_labels` - (Optional) The GCE resource labels (a map of key/value pairs) to be applied to the cluster.

* `resource_usage_export_config` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) Configuration for the
    [ResourceUsageExportConfig](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-usage-metering) feature.
    Structure is documented below.

    It is enabled by default;
    set `disabled = true` to disable.

* `http_load_balancing` - (Optional) The status of the HTTP (L7) load balancing
    controller addon, which makes it easy to set up HTTP load balancers for services in a
    cluster. It is enabled by default; set `disabled = true` to disable.

* `network_policy_config` - (Optional) Whether we should enable the network policy addon
    for the master.  This must be enabled in order to enable network policy for the nodes.
    To enable this, you must also define a [`network_policy`](#network_policy) block,
    otherwise nothing will happen.
    It can only be disabled if the nodes already do not have network policies enabled.
    Defaults to disabled; set `disabled = false` to enable.

* `istio_config` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)).
    Structure is documented below.

* `boot_disk_kms_key` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) The Customer Managed Encryption Key used to encrypt the boot disk attached to each node in the node pool. This should be of the form projects/[KEY_PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[RING_NAME]/cryptoKeys/[KEY_NAME]. For more information about protecting resources with Cloud KMS Keys please see: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption

* `service_account` - (Optional) The service account to be used by the Node VMs.
    If not specified, the "default" service account is used.
    In order to use the configured `oauth_scopes` for logging and monitoring, the service account being used needs the
    [roles/logging.logWriter](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#stackdriver_logging_roles) and
    [roles/monitoring.metricWriter](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#stackdriver_monitoring_roles) roles.

     -> Projects that enable the [Cloud Compute Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) with Terraform may need these roles added manually to the service account. Projects that enable the API in the Cloud Console should have them added automatically.

* `shielded_instance_config` - (Optional) Shielded Instance options. Structure is documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional) The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to identify
    valid sources or targets for network firewalls.

* `taint` - (Optional) A list of [Kubernetes taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)
to apply to nodes. GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable certain features such
as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause Terraform to
recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
Kubernetes (eg. through `kubectl`), and it's recommended that you do not use
this field to manage taints. If you do, `lifecycle.ignore_changes` is
recommended. Structure is documented below.

* `workload_metadata_config` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) Metadata configuration to expose to workloads on the node pool.
    Structure is documented below.

The `guest_accelerator` block supports:

* `type` (Required) - The accelerator type resource to expose to this instance. E.g. `nvidia-tesla-k80`.

* `count` (Required) - The number of the guest accelerator cards exposed to this instance.

The `workload_identity_config` block supports:

* `identity_namespace` (Required) - Currently, the only supported identity namespace is the project's default.

```hcl
workload_identity_config {
  identity_namespace = "${data.google_project.project.project_id}.svc.id.goog"
}
```

The `pod_security_policy_config` block supports:

* `enabled` (Required) - Enable the PodSecurityPolicy controller for this cluster.
    If enabled, pods must be valid under a PodSecurityPolicy to be created.

The `private_cluster_config` block supports:

* `enable_private_nodes` (Optional) - Enables the private cluster feature,
creating a private endpoint on the cluster. In a private cluster, nodes only
have RFC 1918 private addresses and communicate with the master's private
endpoint via private networking.

* `enable_private_endpoint` (Optional) - When `true`, the cluster's private
endpoint is used as the cluster endpoint and access through the public endpoint
is disabled. When `false`, either endpoint can be used. This field only applies
to private clusters, when `enable_private_nodes` is `true`.

* `master_ipv4_cidr_block` (Optional) - The IP range in CIDR notation to use for
the hosted master network. This range will be used for assigning private IP
addresses to the cluster master(s) and the ILB VIP. This range must not overlap
with any other ranges in use within the cluster's network, and it must be a /28
subnet. See [Private Cluster Limitations](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#limitations)
for more details. This field only applies to private clusters, when
`enable_private_nodes` is `true`.

In addition, the `private_cluster_config` allows access to the following read-only fields:

* `peering_name` - The name of the peering between this cluster and the Google owned VPC.

* `private_endpoint` - The internal IP address of this cluster's master endpoint.

* `public_endpoint` - The external IP address of this cluster's master endpoint.

!> The Google provider is unable to validate certain configurations of
`private_cluster_config` when `enable_private_nodes` is `false`. It's
recommended that you omit the block entirely if the field is not set to `true`.

The `sandbox_config` block supports:

* `sandbox_type` (Required) Which sandbox to use for pods in the node pool.
    Accepted values are:

    * `"gvisor"`: Pods run within a gVisor sandbox.

The `release_channel` block supports:

* `channel` - (Required) The selected release channel.
    Accepted values are:
    * UNSPECIFIED: Not set.
    * RAPID: Weekly upgrade cadence; Early testers and developers who requires new features.
    * REGULAR: Multiple per month upgrade cadence; Production users who need features not yet offered in the Stable channel.
    * STABLE: Every few months upgrade cadence; Production users who need stability above all else, and for whom frequent upgrades are too risky.

The `resource_usage_export_config` block supports:

* `enable_network_egress_metering` (Optional) - Whether to enable network egress metering for this cluster. If enabled, a daemonset will be created
    in the cluster to meter network egress traffic.

* `bigquery_destination` (Required) - Parameters for using BigQuery as the destination of resource usage export.

* `bigquery_destination.dataset_id` (Required) - The ID of a BigQuery Dataset. For Example:

```hcl
resource_usage_export_config {
  enable_network_egress_metering = false

  bigquery_destination {
    dataset_id = "cluster_resource_usage"
  }
}
```

The `shielded_instance_config` block supports:

* `enable_secure_boot` (Optional) - Defines if the instance has Secure Boot enabled.

Secure Boot helps ensure that the system only runs authentic software by verifying the digital signature of all boot components, and halting the boot process if signature verification fails.  Defaults to `false`.

* `enable_integrity_monitoring` (Optional) - Defines if the instance has integrity monitoring enabled.

Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly trusted boot image when the instance is created.  Defaults to `true`.

The `taint` block supports:

* `key` (Required) Key for taint.

* `value` (Required) Value for taint.

* `effect` (Required) Effect for taint. Accepted values are `NO_SCHEDULE`, `PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE`, and `NO_EXECUTE`.

The `workload_metadata_config` block supports:

* `node_metadata` (Required) How to expose the node metadata to the workload running on the node.
    Accepted values are:
    * UNSPECIFIED: Not Set
    * SECURE: Prevent workloads not in hostNetwork from accessing certain VM metadata, specifically kube-env, which contains Kubelet credentials, and the instance identity token. See [Metadata Concealment](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/metadata-proxy) documentation.
    * EXPOSE: Expose all VM metadata to pods.
    * GKE_METADATA_SERVER: Enables [workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) on the node.

The `vertical_pod_autoscaling` block supports:

* `enabled` (Required) - Enables vertical pod autoscaling

    to the cluster.

* `label_fingerprint` - The fingerprint of the set of labels for this cluster.

* `maintenance_policy.0.daily_maintenance_window.0.duration` - Duration of the time window, automatically chosen to be
    smallest possible in the given scenario.
    Duration will be in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format "PTnHnMnS".

* `master_auth.0.client_certificate` - Base64 encoded public certificate

    to authenticate to the cluster endpoint.

* `master_auth.0.cluster_ca_certificate` - Base64 encoded public certificate
    that is the root of trust for the cluster.

* `master_version` - The current version of the master in the cluster. This may
    be different than the `min_master_version` set in the config if the master
    has been updated by GKE.

* `tpu_ipv4_cidr_block` - ([Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) The IP address range of the Cloud TPUs in this cluster, in
    [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
    notation (e.g. `1.2.3.4/29`).

* `services_ipv4_cidr` - The IP address range of the Kubernetes services in this
  cluster, in [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
  notation (e.g. `1.2.3.4/29`). Service addresses are typically put in the last
  `/16` from the container CIDR.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 40 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 60 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 40 minutes.

## Import

GKE clusters can be imported using the `project` , `location`, and `name`. If the project is omitted, the default
provider value will be used. Examples:

```
$ terraform import google_container_cluster.mycluster projects/my-gcp-project/locations/us-east1-a/clusters/my-cluster

$ terraform import google_container_cluster.mycluster my-gcp-project/us-east1-a/my-cluster

$ terraform import google_container_cluster.mycluster us-east1-a/my-cluster
```

~> **Note:** This resource has several fields that control Terraform-specific behavior and aren't present in the API. If they are set in config and you import a cluster, Terraform may need to perform an update immediately after import. Most of these updates should be no-ops but some may modify your cluster if the imported state differs.

For example, the following fields will show diffs if set in config:

- `min_master_version`
- `remove_default_node_pool`
