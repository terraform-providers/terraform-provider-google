# google\_sql\_database\_instance

Creates a new Google SQL Database Instance. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/),
or the [JSON API](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/admin-api/v1beta4/instances).

~> **NOTE on `google_sql_database_instance`:** - First-generation instances have been
deprecated and should no longer be created, see [upgrade docs](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/upgrade-2nd-gen)
for more details.
To upgrade your First-generation instance, update your Terraform config that the instance has
* `settings.ip_configuration.ipv4_enabled=true`
* `settings.backup_configuration.enabled=true`
* `settings.backup_configuration.binary_log_enabled=true`.
Apply the terraform config, then upgrade the instance in the console as described in the documentation.
Once upgraded, update the following attributes in your Terraform config to the correct value according to
the above documentation:
* `region`
* `database_version` (if applicable)
* `tier`
Remove any fields that are not applicable to Second-generation instances:
* `settings.crash_safe_replication`
* `settings.replication_type`
* `settings.authorized_gae_applications`
And change values to appropriate values for Second-generation instances for:
* `activation_policy` ("ON_DEMAND" is no longer an option)
* `pricing_plan` ("PER_USE" is now the only valid option)
Change `settings.backup_configuration.enabled` attribute back to its desired value and apply as necessary.

~> **NOTE on `google_sql_database_instance`:** - Second-generation instances include a
default 'root'@'%' user with no password. This user will be deleted by Terraform on
instance creation. You should use `google_sql_user` to define a custom user with
a restricted host and strong password.

-> **Note**: On newer versions of the provider, you must explicitly set `deletion_protection=false`
(and run `terraform apply` to write the field to state) in order to destroy an instance.
It is recommended to not set this field (or set it to true) until you're ready to destroy the instance and its databases.

## Example Usage

### SQL Second Generation Instance

```hcl
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "master" {
  name             = "master-instance"
  database_version = "POSTGRES_11"
  region           = "us-central1"

  settings {
    # Second-generation instance tiers are based on the machine
    # type. See argument reference below.
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
  }
}
```

### Granular restriction of network access

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "apps" {
  count        = 8
  name         = "apps-${count.index + 1}"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "ubuntu-os-cloud/ubuntu-1804-lts"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    network = "default"

    access_config {
      // Ephemeral IP
    }
  }
}

resource "random_id" "db_name_suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}

locals {
  onprem = ["192.168.1.2", "192.168.2.3"]
}

resource "google_sql_database_instance" "postgres" {
  name             = "postgres-instance-${random_id.db_name_suffix.hex}"
  database_version = "POSTGRES_11"

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"

    ip_configuration {

      dynamic "authorized_networks" {
        for_each = google_compute_instance.apps
        iterator = apps

        content {
          name  = apps.value.name
          value = apps.value.network_interface.0.access_config.0.nat_ip
        }
      }

      dynamic "authorized_networks" {
        for_each = local.onprem
        iterator = onprem

        content {
          name  = "onprem-${onprem.key}"
          value = onprem.value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Private IP Instance
~> **NOTE:** For private IP instance setup, note that the `google_sql_database_instance` does not actually interpolate values from `google_service_networking_connection`. You must explicitly add a `depends_on`reference as shown below.

```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "private_network" {
  provider = google-beta

  name = "private-network"
}

resource "google_compute_global_address" "private_ip_address" {
  provider = google-beta

  name          = "private-ip-address"
  purpose       = "VPC_PEERING"
  address_type  = "INTERNAL"
  prefix_length = 16
  network       = google_compute_network.private_network.id
}

resource "google_service_networking_connection" "private_vpc_connection" {
  provider = google-beta

  network                 = google_compute_network.private_network.id
  service                 = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
  reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.private_ip_address.name]
}

resource "random_id" "db_name_suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}

resource "google_sql_database_instance" "instance" {
  provider = google-beta

  name   = "private-instance-${random_id.db_name_suffix.hex}"
  region = "us-central1"

  depends_on = [google_service_networking_connection.private_vpc_connection]

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
    ip_configuration {
      ipv4_enabled    = false
      private_network = google_compute_network.private_network.self_link
    }
  }
}

provider "google-beta" {
  region = "us-central1"
  zone   = "us-central1-a"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region the instance will sit in. Note, Cloud SQL is not
    available in all regions - choose from one of the options listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/instance-locations).
    A valid region must be provided to use this resource. If a region is not provided in the resource definition,
    the provider region will be used instead, but this will be an apply-time error for instances if the provider
    region is not supported with Cloud SQL. If you choose not to provide the `region` argument for this resource,
    make sure you understand this.

- - -

* `settings` - (Optional) The settings to use for the database. The
    configuration is detailed below. Required if `clone` is not set.

* `database_version` - (Optional, Default: `MYSQL_5_6`) The MySQL, PostgreSQL or
SQL Server (beta) version to use. Supported values include `MYSQL_5_6`,
`MYSQL_5_7`, `MYSQL_8_0`, `POSTGRES_9_6`,`POSTGRES_10`, `POSTGRES_11`,
`POSTGRES_12`, `POSTGRES_13`, `SQLSERVER_2017_STANDARD`,
`SQLSERVER_2017_ENTERPRISE`, `SQLSERVER_2017_EXPRESS`, `SQLSERVER_2017_WEB`.
[Database Version Policies](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/db-versions)
includes an up-to-date reference of supported versions.

* `name` - (Optional, Computed) The name of the instance. If the name is left
    blank, Terraform will randomly generate one when the instance is first
    created. This is done because after a name is used, it cannot be reused for
    up to [one week](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/delete-instance).

* `master_instance_name` - (Optional) The name of the existing instance that will
    act as the master in the replication setup. Note, this requires the master to
    have `binary_log_enabled` set, as well as existing backups.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `replica_configuration` - (Optional) The configuration for replication. The
    configuration is detailed below. Valid only for MySQL instances.

* `root_password` - (Optional) Initial root password. Required for MS SQL Server, ignored by MySQL and PostgreSQL.

* `encryption_key_name` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))
    The full path to the encryption key used for the CMEK disk encryption.  Setting
    up disk encryption currently requires manual steps outside of Terraform.
    The provided key must be in the same region as the SQL instance.  In order
    to use this feature, a special kind of service account must be created and
    granted permission on this key.  This step can currently only be done
    manually, please see [this step](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-cmek#service-account).
    That service account needs the `Cloud KMS > Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter` role on your
    key - please see [this step](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-cmek#grantkey).

* `deletion_protection` - (Optional, Default: `true` ) Whether or not to allow Terraform to destroy the instance. Unless this field is set to false
in Terraform state, a `terraform destroy` or `terraform apply` command that deletes the instance will fail.

* `restore_backup_context` - (optional) The context needed to restore the database to a backup run. This field will
    cause Terraform to trigger the database to restore from the backup run indicated. The configuration is detailed below.
    **NOTE:** Restoring from a backup is an imperative action and not recommended via Terraform. Adding or modifying this
    block during resource creation/update will trigger the restore action after the resource is created/updated.

* `clone` - (Optional) The context needed to create this instance as a clone of another instance. When this field is set during
    resource creation, Terraform will attempt to clone another instance as indicated in the context. The
    configuration is detailed below.

* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.

* `connection_name` - The connection name of the instance to be used in
connection strings. For example, when connecting with [Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-admin-proxy).

* `service_account_email_address` - The service account email address assigned to the
instance.

* `ip_address.0.ip_address` - The IPv4 address assigned.

* `ip_address.0.time_to_retire` - The time this IP address will be retired, in RFC
    3339 format.

* `ip_address.0.type` - The type of this IP address.

  * A `PRIMARY` address is an address that can accept incoming connections.

  * An `OUTGOING` address is the source address of connections originating from the instance, if supported.

  * A `PRIVATE` address is an address for an instance which has been configured to use private networking see: [Private IP](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip).

when the resource is configured with a `count`.

* `public_ip_address` - The first public (`PRIMARY`) IPv4 address assigned. This is
a workaround for an [issue fixed in Terraform 0.12](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17048)
but also provides a convenient way to access an IP of a specific type without
performing filtering in a Terraform config.

* `private_ip_address` - The first private (`PRIVATE`) IPv4 address assigned. This is
a workaround for an [issue fixed in Terraform 0.12](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17048)
but also provides a convenient way to access an IP of a specific type without
performing filtering in a Terraform config.

* `server_ca_cert.0.sha1_fingerprint` - SHA Fingerprint of the CA Cert.

## Timeouts

`google_sql_database_instance` provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 30 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 30 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 30 minutes.

## Import

Database instances can be imported using one of any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_sql_database_instance.master projects/{{project}}/instances/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_sql_database_instance.master {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_sql_database_instance.master {{name}}

```

~> **NOTE:** Some fields (such as `replica_configuration`) won't show a diff if they are unset in
config and set on the server.
When importing, double-check that your config has all the fields set that you expect- just seeing
no diff isn't sufficient to know that your config could reproduce the imported resource.
